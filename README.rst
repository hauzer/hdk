An AutoHotkey script for Dota. It features spells and inventory remapping and has a leaderboard hotkey.
It has the ability to automatically insert text into chat at the beginning of every game.

- You can modify the hotkeys in the file hdk.ini. If it doesn't exist, it will be created when you first run HDK.
- Learn the syntax of hotkeys at http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm.

Known Bugs/Cavaets/Limitations
==============================

- **You have to disable UAC in Windows 7 for the script to work!**
  This is a limitation of AutoHotkey itself.

- The script will be paused only when chatting. If you want to, for example,
  exit the game using the F10 menu, you'll have to first manually pause the script.
  
- Toggling the leaderboard may not work if you're clicking and/or moving the mouse at the same time.
  This is a limitation of the game.

- When you change the brightness of Warcraft III, you have to restart both HDK and the game.

- Dota detection is not perfect, bear that in mind.
